How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    might as well just use diff

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    not sure

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    programitcaly, there will be many version that are broken and should NOT be saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    programicalty several files may need to be updated for a bug fix, but
	a document is just a document

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    dont know (yet)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    very, since i can easly rollback the changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    already use it
